It is an adult art club that features multiple sessions with art teachers!
It is a complemetary service to provide enjoyment and spark an inspiration in making art a hobby!

Testing:
There was a struggle with opening the broswer, as it showed error response multiple times. However, after some time, I discovered the issue was that was with my file naming that interfered with file path to open the browser.
